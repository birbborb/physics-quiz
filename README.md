# Physics Quiz
A simple quiz about physics equations. It will randomly generate a equations and give the user random values (numbers) and ask the user to enter the result. The user will be told what topic/formula it is, and is expected to know the formulas - no further assistance will be given. The answer will have to be rounded to the nearest two decimals to be accepted.

It's worth noting that I've quite a fair chunk of JavaScript in `index.html`, so it would perhaps be a good idea to move it over to a seperate `.js` file.
